## Bio

Hi! I'm Sean Bray. I'm a software developer, data scientist, scholar of machine learning and test engineering, eagle scout, and imaginary comedian. I like math, science, coding, and team efforts toward shared visions. I spend a significant portion of every day pondering how I can use my tech skills to make sure people are fed, breathing clean air, and drinking clean water in an era where climate change progressively increases its threat to these goals. I also think about which of these contributions I could make while also making a career for myself.
