## Bio

Hi! I'm Sean Bray. I'm a software developer, data scientist, scholar of machine learning and test engineering, eagle scout, and comedy enthusiest. I like math, science, coding, and team efforts toward shared visions. I spend a significant portion of every day pondering how I can use my tech skills to make sure people are fed, breathing clean air, and drinking clean water in an era where climate change progressively increases its threat to these goals. I also think about which of these contributions I could make while also making a career for myself.

## Summary of Proprietary Projects

By far, the two largest software projects I ever worked on were completely proprietary, and thus I cannot link them below like some other projects I enjoyed. 

### SeanBrayKodiak

SeanBrayKodiak is my old github account with my previous employer, Kodiak Robotics. With that account I wrote many thousands of lines of python, and a few dozen lines of several other languages, automating my job and my teammates jobs. In the end, my role was largely about programatically shifting data around different platforms, developing and maintaining tools to do so, and performing analytics on that data. Using python and other languages, I interacted with Jira's REST API to automatically update tickets with my coworkers analysis, as well as synchronize data with the backend non-relational database using their REST API. Furthermore, I synced data in both of those sources with the outputs of our simulation tests, in order to help my team prioritize work and speed up their analysis toolkits.

### Natural-Language-Processing for market predictions

My second largest individual coding project was as part of my "capstone" project for my Masters in Molecular Science and Software Engineering at UC Berkeley. I worked in association with Pivotal Life Sciences to try to scrape relevant text data, and architected several layers of machine learning model to analyze the text, extract features of interest, and try to predict several companies of interest's future market capitalizations.

## Public Repositorys from my Masters Program at UC Berkeley

The following are my top 2 favorite projects from my masters program. I'm sticking to two because firstly, these stood out to me as my favorites and secondly, the next 3 things on my list would have revealed homework assignment specific information, which I'm not allowed and wouldn't want to do. 

### 3d graphical representations of electron densities, molecular orbitals, and atomic orbitals per CNDO/2 - SCF theory.

### Data analytics and linear regression modeling of air quality emissions data and correlations with CO2equivalent emissions measurements -

## Professional interests

I'm interested in doing any work where I can make a career achieving my above-stated goal of using technology to help humanity adapt to climate change. The three categories. I believe my data science skills, my deep coding experience, my generalist science background, and my math skills can help me achieve this in a broad variety of ways. There are three which I have thought the most about:

1) Agricultural robotics
2) Green energy (probably nuclear makes the most sense for my skillset, but any green energy folks needing a data science or software engineer, feel free to reach out)
3) Genetically modified crops
