Hi! I'm Sean Bray. I'm a software developer, data scientist, test engineer, eagle scout, and imaginary comedian. I like math, science, coding, and I spend a significant portion of every day pondering how I can use my tech skills to make sure people stay fed, breath clean air, and drink clean water, while also making a career for myself.
