        <h2>Sean Bray - Data Scientist and Back-end Developer</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Sean Paul Bray. I'm a software developer, data scientist, environmentalist, test designer, learner of machine learning, Eagle Scout, and comedy enthusiast. I enjoy math, science, coding, and team efforts toward shared visions. I spend a significant portion of every day pondering how I can use my tech skills to ensure people are fed, breathe clean air, and drink clean water in an era where climate change increasingly threatens these goals. I also consider how I can make these contributions while building a career for myself.</p>

        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>The best way to reach me is via e-mail at <a href="mailto:sean.bray23@gmail.com">sean.bray23@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="proprietary-projects">Summary of Proprietary Projects</h2>
        <p>By far, the two largest software projects I ever worked on were completely proprietary, skip to the Public Repositories header if you're hungry for examples.</p>

        <h3>SeanBrayKodiak</h3>
        <p>SeanBrayKodiak is my old GitHub account with my previous employer, Kodiak Robotics. With that account, I wrote many thousands of lines of Python, and a few dozen lines of several other languages, automating my job and my teammates' jobs. By the end of my QA career, my role was largely about programmatically shifting data around different platforms, developing and maintaining tools to do so, and performing analytics on that data. Using Python and other languages, I interacted with Jira's REST API to automatically update tickets with my coworkers' analysis, as well as synchronize data with the backend non-relational database using their REST API. Furthermore, I synced data in both of those sources with the outputs of our simulation tests, in order to help my team prioritize work and speed up their analysis toolkits. Sounds easy, but was a lot of work!</p>

        <h3>Natural-Language-Processing for market predictions</h3>
        <p>My second largest coding project was capstone project for my Masters in Molecular Science and Software Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. I worked in association with Pivotal Life Sciences to scrape relevant text data, and architected several layers of machine learning model to analyze the text, extract features of interest, and try to predict several companies of interest's future market capitalizations.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/EnviroTechSean/chem279_final_project">3D Electron Density Visualizer</a></h3>
            <p>A project from my Masters program at UC Berkeley. This involved creating 3D graphical representations of electron densities, molecular orbitals, and atomic orbitals based on CNDO/2 - SCF theory.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/EnviroTechSean/AirQualityAnalysis">Air Quality Data Analysis</a></h3>
            <p>Another project from my Masters program focusing on data analytics and linear regression modeling of air quality emissions data and its correlations with CO2 equivalent emissions measurements.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn</p>

        <h2 id="professional-interests">Professional Interests</h2>
        <p>I'm interested in doing any work where I can make a career achieving my above-stated goal of using technology to help humanity adapt to climate change. The three categories I believe my data science skills, my deep coding experience, my generalist science background, and my math skills can help me achieve this in a broad variety of ways. Here are three areas I have thought most about:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Agricultural robotics</li>
            <li>Low-Emissions transportation of goods and people</li>
            <li>Green energy (probably nuclear makes the most sense for my skillset, but any green energy folks needing a data sciencist or software engineer for something like simulation or automation, feel free to reach out)</li>
            <li>Genetically modified crops</li>
        </ol>
